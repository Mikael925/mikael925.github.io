        <div class="details-content">
          <p>My passion for games goes back to playing Unreal Tournament, at just 6 years old. That spark from my first game has never left me. That interest has been with me ever since. During my technical studies in high school, I started learning Blender and created my first 3D models. However, I then took a long pause for my voluntary military service, where I served for 8 years. Now, I feel ready to return to my passion for games, using my creative mindset and the tools I've learned along the way to guide me.</p>
          <p>My 8 years of service as a veteran in the Swedish Armed Forces taught me to enjoy structure, to be drawn to challenges, and to thrive when I have a clear goal and responsibility. I am a problem-solver who expects high standards and values an open environment where all ideas can be discussed. Finding the path forward is my specialty.</p>

    <h1 class="page-title">The Generalist Advantage</h1>
    <p>My core strength is seeing the bigger picture. For me, being a generalist is about understanding the entirety of game development, which allows me to help the team find fitting solutions for whatever problems we encounter. I am a determined team player, focused on seeing every task through to the end. My loyalty is to the project and the team's success—a principle reinforced by my 8 years of service in the Swedish Armed Forces. My approach is built on a simple foundation: executing my own assigned tasks to the highest standard, and then leveraging my broad knowledge to elevate the entire team. </p>
