  <h1 class="page-title">About me</h1>
   
  <div class="content-text">
    <h3>Welcome to my portfolio.</h3>
    <p>My name is Mikael Johan Rosenhed, born in Sweden 1995, and I am currently a Game Design student at Future Games.</p>

<p>My passion for games goes back to playing Unreal Tournament, at just 6 years old. That spark from my first game has never left me. That interest has been with me ever since. During my technical studies in high school, I started learning Blender and created my first 3D models. However, I then took a long pause for my voluntary military service, where I served for 8 years. Now, I feel ready to return to my passion for games, using my creative mindset and the tools I've learned along the way to guide me.</p>

<p>My 8 years of service as a veteran in the Swedish Armed Forces taught me to enjoy structure, to be drawn to challenges, and to thrive when I have a clear goal and responsibility. I am a problem-solver who expects high standards and values an open environment where all ideas can be discussed. Finding the path forward is my specialty.</p>

<p>I have embraced the generalist role because my primary function is to serve as a support hub for all disciplines and a driver for project momentum. Ultimately, my focus is always on the objective and delivering measurable results.</p>

<p>Feel free to look through my work, and don't hesitate to reach out via email or connect with me on LinkedIn.</p>

  <h1 class="page-title">The Generalist Advantage</h1>
  <p>My core strength is seeing the bigger picture. For me, being a generalist is about understanding the entirety of game development, which allows me to help the team find fitting solutions for whatever problems we encounter. I am a determined team player, focused on seeing every task through to the end. My loyalty is to the project and the team's success—a principle reinforced by my 8 years of service in the Swedish Armed Forces. My approach is built on a simple foundation: executing my own assigned tasks to the highest standard, and then leveraging my broad knowledge to elevate the entire team. </p>

        <h3>1. A Communication Hub and Translator</h3>
        <p>Because I understand the fundamentals of level design, sound design, scripting, and art pipelines, I can 'speak the language' of each department. I can effectively translate an artist's needs to a programmer or explain a technical constraint to a designer.</p>
        <p class="strength-value"><strong>Value:</strong> This drastically reduces friction, prevents misunderstandings, and saves valuable time that would otherwise be lost in translation. It ensures everyone is aligned and working towards the same vision.</p>

    <div class="strength-item">
        <h3>2. Proactive Workflow and Structure</h3>
        <p>My broad knowledge allows me to anticipate the needs of different departments. I can see the bigger picture and identify potential dependencies or bottlenecks before they become critical problems. For example, knowing what a sound designer needs from the level design early on, or how a new character feature will impact the animation pipeline.</p>
        <p class="strength-value"><strong>Value:</strong> This foresight leads to better planning, a smoother workflow, and fewer unexpected delays. It allows me to help structure tasks in a logical order, ensuring that no one is left waiting for a deliverable.</p>

        <h3>3. Agile Support and Problem-Solving</h3>
        <p>In any project, small but critical tasks inevitably pop up that fall outside a specialist's main duties. Whether it's implementing placeholder audio, setting up basic lighting for a test build, or creating simple UI mockups, I have the versatility to step in and get the job done, without ever losing sight of my own core responsibilities. </p>
        <p class="strength-value"><strong>Value:</strong> This prevents bottlenecks and keeps the project's momentum going. It frees up specialists to focus on their core, high-impact tasks, making the entire team more efficient. I act as a force multiplier, filling the gaps wherever needed to ensure we never lose our way forward.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>My function as a generalist is to empower the team by providing support, structure, and clarity. I thrive on taking ownership of the development process, ensuring all disciplines work in harmony to deliver a high-quality game on schedule. At my core, I'm the proactive team member who constantly asks, "What's needed to get this done?" and then ensures it happens.</p>
