  <h1 class="page-title">The Generalist Advantage</h1>
  <p>My core strength is seeing the bigger picture. For me, being a generalist is about understanding the entirety of game development, which allows me to help the team find fitting solutions for whatever problems we encounter.

I am a determined team player, focused on seeing every task through to the end. My loyalty is to the project and the team's success—a principle reinforced by my 8 years of service in the Swedish Armed Forces.

Mina Styrkor som Generalist (Ditt Värde för Teamet)
Använd underrubriker eller en punktlista. För varje punkt, beskriv styrkan och förklara sedan värdet för teamet/projektet.

1. A Communication Hub and Translator

Because I understand the fundamentals of level design, sound design, scripting, and art pipelines, I can 'speak the language' of each department. I can effectively translate an artist's needs to a programmer or explain a technical constraint to a designer.

This drastically reduces friction, prevents misunderstandings, and saves valuable time that would otherwise be lost in translation. It ensures everyone is aligned and working towards the same vision.

2. Proactive Workflow and Structure

My broad knowledge allows me to anticipate the needs of different departments. I can see the bigger picture and identify potential dependencies or bottlenecks before they become critical problems. For example, knowing what a sound designer needs from the level design early on, or how a new character feature will impact the animation pipeline.

This foresight leads to better planning, a smoother workflow, and fewer unexpected delays. It allows me to help structure tasks in a logical order, ensuring that no one is left waiting for a deliverable.

3. Agile Support and Problem-Solving

In any project, small but critical tasks inevitably pop up that fall outside a specialist's main duties. Whether it's implementing placeholder audio, setting up basic lighting for a test build, or creating simple UI mockups, I have the versatility to step in and get the job done.

This prevents bottlenecks and keeps the project's momentum going. It frees up specialists to focus on their core, high-impact tasks, making the entire team more efficient. I act as a force multiplier, filling the gaps wherever needed to ensure we never lose our way forward.

Summary:

my goal as a generalist is to be a servant leader for the team—to provide support, structure, and clarity. I thrive on taking ownership of the process, ensuring all parts of the development machine work in harmony to deliver a high-quality game on schedule. I'm the team member who constantly asks 'What do we need to get this done?' and then helps make it happen.
