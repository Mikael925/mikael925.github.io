  <h1 class="page-title">The Generalist Advantage</h1>
  <p>My core strength is seeing the bigger picture. For me, being a generalist is about understanding the entirety of game development, which allows me to help the team find fitting solutions for whatever problems we encounter. I am a determined team player, focused on seeing every task through to the end. My loyalty is to the project and the team's success—a principle reinforced by my 8 years of service in the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>

        <h3>1. A Communication Hub and Translator</h3>
        <p>Because I understand the fundamentals of level design, sound design, scripting, and art pipelines, I can 'speak the language' of each department. I can effectively translate an artist's needs to a programmer or explain a technical constraint to a designer.</p>
        <p class="strength-value"><strong>Value:</strong> This drastically reduces friction, prevents misunderstandings, and saves valuable time that would otherwise be lost in translation. It ensures everyone is aligned and working towards the same vision.</p>

        <h3>2. Proactive Workflow and Structure</h3>
        <p>My broad knowledge allows me to anticipate the needs of different departments. I can see the bigger picture and identify potential dependencies or bottlenecks before they become critical problems. For example, knowing what a sound designer needs from the level design early on, or how a new character feature will impact the animation pipeline.</p>
        <p class="strength-value"><strong>Value:</strong> This foresight leads to better planning, a smoother workflow, and fewer unexpected delays. It allows me to help structure tasks in a logical order, ensuring that no one is left waiting for a deliverable.</p>

        <h3>3. Agile Support and Problem-Solving</h3>
        <p>In any project, small but critical tasks inevitably pop up that fall outside a specialist's main duties. Whether it's implementing placeholder audio, setting up basic lighting for a test build, or creating simple UI mockups, I have the versatility to step in and get the job done.</p>
        <p class="strength-value"><strong>Value:</strong> This prevents bottlenecks and keeps the project's momentum going. It frees up specialists to focus on their core, high-impact tasks, making the entire team more efficient. I act as a force multiplier, filling the gaps wherever needed to ensure we never lose our way forward.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>My goal as a generalist is to be a servant leader for the team—to provide support, structure, and clarity. I thrive on taking ownership of the process, ensuring all parts of the development machine work in harmony to deliver a high-quality game on schedule. I'm the team member who constantly asks 'What do we need to get this done?' and then helps make it happen.</p>
