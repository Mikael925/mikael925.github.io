      <p>This solo project was a 5-day rapid prototyping challenge with a core constraint: tell a complete, emotional story using only character animation and environmental cues, with no dialogue. The result is 'Junkbot and Dog,' a narrative experience exploring an unlikely friendship, a tragic accident, and a permanent, robotic solution to loss.</p>
<p><strong>This prototype represents the first chapter of a larger concept, which is fully detailed in a Game Design Document I have written, outlining a complete three-chapter narrative arc for 'Junkbot and Dog'.</strong></p>

  <h3>Concept & Narrative Goal</h3>
  <div class="stage-description">
    <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Concept & Narrative Goal:</strong> The concept for 'Junkbot and Dog' originated from an old painting by my sister, which sparked the idea for a silent story about companionship. I immediately began outlining the narrative beats and core mechanics in a Game Design Document (GDD). When our 5-day rapid prototyping course began, this concept was a perfect fit for the main objective: to create a complete narrative prototype where the story was told exclusively through character animation and interaction, without any dialogue.

            <strong>Establishing Motivation:</strong> I designed the initial gameplay loop around a clear player need—the robot's low battery—which naturally guides the player to the charging station and facilitates the first meeting with the dog.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Conveying Emotion through Animation:</strong> Every story beat was prototyped through character movement. This included the dog's trusting animations as it guides the player, the robot's visible effort when lifting the trap, and the final, desperate sequence of trying to revive its injured friend.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Environmental Storytelling:</strong> To support the main narrative, I placed key environmental cues for the player to discover, such as the old trap that foreshadows danger and the subsequent blood trail that creates a sense of urgency and drives the final act of the story.
