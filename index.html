    <h3>Welcome to my portfolio.</h3>
    <p>My name is Mikael Johan Rosenhed, born in Sweden 1995, and I am currently a Game Design student at Future Games.

    I am a veteran of the Swedish Armed Forces with 8 years of service. I enjoy structure, am drawn to challenges, and I thrive when I have a clear goal and responsibility.

    I expect high standards and value an open environment where all ideas can be discussed. I am a problem-solver, not afraid of conflict, and finding the path forward is my specialty.

    I have chosen the role of a generalist to be able to support all disciplines, ensuring that we always have forward momentum in our projects. The objective and seeing results are what matter most to me.

My passion for games started when I was young. I began playing Unreal Tournament in 1999, at 9 years old, and my interest has been with me ever since. During my technical studies in high school, I started learning Blender and created my first 3D models. However, I then took a long pause for my voluntary military service, where I served for 8 years. Now, I feel ready to return to my passion for games, using my creative mindset and the tools I've learned along the way to guide me.</p>
