    <h3>Welcome to my portfolio.</h3>
    <p>My name is Mikael Johan Rosenhed, born in Sweden 1995, and I am currently a Game Design student at Future Games.</p>

<p>My passion for games started when I was young. The first game I played was Unreal Tournament 1999, at 6 years old, and my interest has been with me ever since. During my technical studies in high school, I started learning Blender and created my first 3D models. However, I then took a long pause for my voluntary military service, where I served for 8 years. Now, I feel ready to return to my passion for games, using my creative mindset and the tools I've learned along the way to guide me.</p>

<p>My 8 years of service as a veteran in the Swedish Armed Forces taught me to enjoy structure, to be drawn to challenges, and to thrive when I have a clear goal and responsibility. I am a problem-solver who expects high standards and values an open environment where all ideas can be discussed. Finding the path forward is my specialty.</p>

<p>Because of this, I have chosen the role of a generalist—to be able to support all disciplines and ensure that we always have forward momentum in our projects. For me, the objective and seeing results are what matter most.</p>
