    <h3>Welcome to my portfolio.</h3>
    <p>My name is Mikael Johan Rosenhed, born in Sweden 1995, and I am currently a Game Design student at Future Games.

    I am a veteran of the Swedish Armed Forces with 8 years of service. I enjoy structure, am drawn to challenges, and I thrive when I have a clear goal and responsibility.

    I expect high standards and value an open environment where all ideas can be discussed. I am a problem-solver, not afraid of conflict, and finding the path forward is my specialty.

    I have chosen the role of a generalist to be able to support all disciplines, ensuring that we always have forward momentum in our projects. The objective and seeing results are what matter most to me.</p>
