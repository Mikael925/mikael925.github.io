      <p>In this group project, I pitched a platformer game where you play as a dragon escaping a volcanic eruption. With lava rising, the goal is to flee the area by climbing higher and higher. For the level design, my goal was to challenge the player while establishing a solid foundation for future development, resulting in a well-sized vertical slice.</p>

        <p>"I want to give a big shoutout to our PO Johan Rosenhed. In my opinion Johan has been our MVP of this project. Especially in the last 2 weeks. All of you have put down hard work and delivered great things. But Johan did such a good job as PO, especially considering this is his first game project."</p>
        <p>"The role of PO is not an easy one, but Johan did a great job and I really appreciate that, I don't think this project could have been anything like it without him."</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The initial focus was on the environment's design. I created a complete blockout of the level using simple geometry to establish the fundamental layout, scale, and player flow. This allowed for early testing of sightlines and composition before any art assets were produced..</li>
                <li>With the blockout in place, I moved on to technical validation and testing the core gameplay loop. This involved verifying that all critical paths were playable and that the environment supported the intended mechanics, such as cover-based combat and platforming sections. The goal was to ensure the design was functionally sound.</li>
                <li>Finally, I gathered foundational feedback from my peers. These early sessions were not about polish, but about validating the core concept. The positive feedback on the level's flow and premise confirmed that our design was on the right track, giving us a solid and validated foundation to build upon for the Beta phase.</li>

      <h4>What Went Well:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Our team communication, using Jira and daily standups, was excellent and kept everyone aligned.</li>
        <li>I'm proud of the custom VFX I created, as they significantly enhanced the game's atmosphere on a tight schedule.</li>

      <h4>What Could Be Improved:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>In hindsight, we should have allocated more time for audio implementation in the planning phase. This led to a stressful final week for sound integration.</li>
        <li>I learned that I need to be better at asking for help from artists earlier, instead of trying to solve visual problems on my own for too long.</li>

      <p>In this project, our team focused on designing a linear, narrative-driven game. It was built to guide the player through a complete mission, taking them from a set starting point to a final objective. The level features three distinct areas: the Village, the Church, and the Ritual Site.</p>

                <li>The beta phase began with structured playtesting sessions focused on clarity and pacing. My primary goal was to identify areas of friction in the player's journey.

                    <li>Through several iterative loops, the level's pacing and difficulty curve were significantly improved. The initial frustrating bottleneck was eliminated, resulting in a smoother and more intuitive player experience that better supported the game's narrative goals.
